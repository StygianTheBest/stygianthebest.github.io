> Procedural water never looked right to me, so it's not included. I tried to enable it just for the ocean with no luck, and it doesn't look right in smaller pools or in water sources in town. I find the default water to be the best looking overall. If you know how to enable it for just the ocean let me know!

#### This project is dedicated to the late Michel Martin Koiter (May 4, 1984 – March 18, 2004). His shrine in World of Warcraft served as a place of solace for myself, my guildmates, and countless others in the classic days of World of Warcraft and beyond.
